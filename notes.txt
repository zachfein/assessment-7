In the case of .push, the time complexity for an array should always be O(1) because only one element is being affected. The element that is pushed. All other elements in the array remain static. In the case of .unshift, the entire array is affected, as an element is added to beginning of the array. All subsequent elements must move back. The runtime complexity is therefore O(n) as the length of the array is relevant. The longer the array, the more complex and taxing the runtime. In most cases, the insert function has a significantly better runtime than the append function as insert uses    .push and append uses .unshift
